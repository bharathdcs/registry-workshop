Intermediate Registry Runbook


Pre-requisites

•	Provision a Linux server on fyre, preferably RHEL 8 server.
•	We don’t need an OpenShift server for this exercise.
•	Login to your server as root user
•	Install git client if its missing – 
                dnf -y install git
•	Clone the repository.
	        git clone https://github.com/bharathdcs/registry-workshop
•	Be prepared with your IBM Entitlement key, we will be using for mirroring operation.

Mirror images to intermediate registry


•	Make the scripts executable – chmod 777 registry-workshop/*.  
•	Run the ./1-pre-requisties.sh to install the dependencies.
•	Prepare your intermediate registry and mirror images by running the following script -
       ./2-intermediate-registry.sh <entitlement key> , pass your entitlement key as an argument.
•	Test whether images were mirrored successfully, by logging into olm-utils pod and validating an image.
	        podman exec -it olm-utils-play-v2 /bin/bash
	        oc image info 127.0.0.1:12443/cpopen/ibm-cpd-platform-operator-bundle:5.4.0-13 --insecure=true


Move your registry to green zone.

•	Now lets simulate moving the intermediate images to green zone, run the following script - 
        ./3-export-intermediate.sh
•	This script will compress cpd-cli-workspace directory and move it to a new directory called green. Both the compressed workspace and green directory can be found inside your $HOME directory.
•	In the subsequent mirror operation, we’ll be using the green directory as our source for images.

Mirror images intermediate to final registry.

•	Perform the final mirror operation by executing the following script – 
	        ./4-mirror-private.sh
•	The script has following variable set to use the green directory as the new workspace, CPD_CLI_MANAGE_WORKSPACE=~/green/cpd-cli-workspace/olm-utils-workspace
•	Try pulling an image from your private registry to confirm whether the mirror operation succeeded
	        podman login --username "admin" --password "passw0rd" $(hostname):5000 --tls-verify=false 
	        podman pull $(hostname):5000/cpopen/ibm-cpd-platform-operator-bundle:5.4.0-13 –tls-verify=false
